I started with Minecraft, programming in Java, and yes, I struggled a lot, but it was a really cool experience. Afterwards, I had some experiences in other Lua games and decided to delve deeper into programming in the Web part - Front-end. Currently, I work as a front-end developer, building dynamic and responsive interfaces with React.JS, optimized with Vite and styled with Styled Components. I have experience in back-end development with Node.JS to create complete applications.`"
